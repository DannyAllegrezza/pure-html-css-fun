    <h1>The Cornish Rex</h1>
    <p>
      A Cornish Rex is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex has no hair
      except for down. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in
      their coats: the outer fur or "guard hairs", a middle layer called the
      "awn hair"; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1
      cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. They are prone to hair
      loss and many will develop a very thin coat or even go bald over large
      parts of their body. The curl in their fur is caused by a different
      mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. The breed originated in
      Cornwall, Great Britain.
    </p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
      The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and sometimes curly. Their
      light coat means that they are best suited for indoor living in warm and
      dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures. They like to
      stay near warm places such as computer monitors, light bulbs, laps and
      shoulders.
    </p>

    <p>
      The breed is sometimes referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because
      of the sleek appearance and the galloping run characteristic of the breed.
      These cats tend to stay playful and kittenish throughout their long lives.
      Some Cornish Rexes like to play fetch, race other pets, or do acrobatic
      jumps. The Cornish Rex is an adventurous cat and is very intelligent. It
      can readily adapt to new situations and will explore wherever it can go.
      The Rex is extremely curious, seeks out the company of people and is
      friendly towards other companion animals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cornish Rex cats come in a wide variety of coat colours and patterns,
      outlined in the breed standard solids, including white, black, chocolate,
      orange and the dilutes blue, lilac and cream; all forms of tabby including
      classic, mackerel and ticked tabbies, bicolor "tuxedo" coat in many
      colours, tortoiseshell, "smoke" colours and the colour-point pattern
      standard in the Siamese breed.
    </p>
    <h2>Genetics</h2>
    <p>
      Genetics In 2013, researchers identified the mutation that defines the
      Cornish Rex breed. Genome-wide analyses were performed in the Cornish Rex
      breed and in 11 phenotypically diverse breeds and two random bred
      populations. A gene on chromosome A1, the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6
      (LPAR6), was identified to have a 4 base pair deletion. This induces a
      premature stop codon in the receptor which is absent in all straight
      haired cats analyzed. LPAR6 encodes a receptor essential for maintaining
      the structural integrity of the hair shaft. In humans, LPAR6 mutations
      result in a form of ectodermal dysplasia characterised by a woolly hair
      phenotype.

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      Origin The Cornish Rex is a genetic mutation that originated from a litter
      of kittens born in the 1950s on a farm in Cornwall, UK.[5] One of the
      kittens, a cream-colored male named Kallibunker, had an extremely unusual,
      fine and curly coat; he was the first Cornish Rex. The owner then
      backcrossed Kallibunker to his mother to produce 2 other curly-coated
      kittens. The male, Poldhu, sired a female called Lamorna Cove who was
      later brought to America and crossed with a Siamese, giving the breed
      their long whippy tails and big ears. The Devon Rex looks similar in
      appearance to the Cornish Rex but has guard hairs and sheds. The Devon Rex
      mutation is different from the Cornish Rex mutation in that the Devon has
      shortened guard hairs, while the Cornish Rex lacks guard hairs altogether.
      Crosses between Devon and Cornish Rexes are not permitted in pedigrees and
      matings between them will not produce a cat with short wavy fur. Another
      hair-deficient breed is the Sphynx cat, which has no hair but may have a
      very light coat of fuzz.
