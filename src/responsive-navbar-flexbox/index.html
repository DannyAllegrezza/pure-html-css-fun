        <h1>The Cornish Rex</h1>
        <p>A Cornish Rex is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex has no hair except for down. Most breeds of cat
            have three
            different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or "guard hairs", a middle layer called the "awn
            hair"; and the
            down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. They
            are prone to
            hair loss and many will develop a very thin coat or even go bald over large parts of their body. The curl in
            their fur
            is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. The breed originated in Cornwall,
            Great Britain.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and sometimes curly. Their light coat means that they are best
            suited for
            indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures. They like to stay near
            warm places
            such as computer monitors, light bulbs, laps and shoulders.

        <p>
            The breed is sometimes referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because of the sleek appearance and the
            galloping run
            characteristic of the breed. These cats tend to stay playful and kittenish throughout their long lives.
            Some Cornish
            Rexes like to play fetch, race other pets, or do acrobatic jumps. The Cornish Rex is an adventurous cat and
            is very
            intelligent. It can readily adapt to new situations and will explore wherever it can go. The Rex is
            extremely curious,
            seeks out the company of people and is friendly towards other companion animals.</p>

        <p>
            Cornish Rex cats come in a wide variety of coat colours and patterns, outlined in the breed standard
            solids,
            including white, black, chocolate, orange and the dilutes blue, lilac and cream; all forms of tabby
            including classic,
            mackerel and ticked tabbies, bicolor "tuxedo" coat in many colours, tortoiseshell, "smoke" colours and the
            colour-point
            pattern standard in the Siamese breed.

        <h2>Genetics</h2>
        <p>
            Genetics
            In 2013, researchers identified the mutation that defines the Cornish Rex breed. Genome-wide analyses were
            performed in
            the Cornish Rex breed and in 11 phenotypically diverse breeds and two random bred populations. A gene on
            chromosome A1,
            the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6), was identified to have a 4 base pair deletion. This induces a
            premature
            stop codon in the receptor which is absent in all straight haired cats analyzed. LPAR6 encodes a receptor
            essential for
            maintaining the structural integrity of the hair shaft. In humans, LPAR6 mutations result in a form of
            ectodermal
            dysplasia characterised by a woolly hair phenotype.
